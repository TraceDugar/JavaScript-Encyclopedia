What is an EC2 Instance?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 500 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload. We are the first major cloud provider that supports Intel, AMD, and Arm processors, the only cloud with on-demand EC2 Mac instances, and the only cloud with 400 Gbps Ethernet networking. We offer the best price performance for machine learning training, as well as the lowest cost per inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, high performance computing (HPC), ML, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud.
<br>

Name 2 use cases for EC2.
Running cloud-native and enterprise applications, as well as Scale for HPC applications, Develop for apple platforms, Train and deploy ML applications.
<br>

Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
The application is massive, and needs to more secure.

<br>

Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
They handle different peak/burst CPU usages.
<br>

Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
First the users enters the app which starts, then it is in service until it begins terminating / Detaching, and then it will end.

What is Elastic Beanstalk?
Is an easy to use service that deploys, manages, and scales web apps and services for people.
<br>

Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
EC2 is leveraged by elastic beanstalk.
<br>

Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
It handles, load balancing, provisioning, auto scaling, app health monitoring!
