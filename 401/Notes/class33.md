What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

<li> Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group. </li>
</ul>
