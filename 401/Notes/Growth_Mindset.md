## Growth Mindset

**Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice**

This exercise taught me that in order to improve you cannot do things that are easy for you.  In order to improve one must take on problems that cause mental strain.
If you dont feel mental strain you are more likely comfortable and stagnating within a skills set.

Professor Dweck goes into how viewing failure as the end is a harmful practice.  Utilizing the power of yet, allows people to understand that they can develope the skills
necessary for them to learn most disciplines.

**Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit**

Angela Expands upon what Professor Dweck was talking about.  She translates it as Grit is the indicator of sucess more so than a number of the other factors.
Grit is just another term for the growth mindset.  Growth Mindset is defined in this video as the intersection of Passion, and Perservereance.

**Alain de Botton on Redefining Success**

Alain explains that we are programmed to believe that success is vastly different than it was a few hundred years ago.  That we have a large number of psycholigical
factors in which the modern definition of sucess is a bit brutal that we place on ourseleves.  He also goes into how peoples perception of failure has become more hostile now than it was a few hundred years ago with his "Unforunate" vs "Loser" analogy.

**Emotional Intellgence Quiz**

This Quiz indicates that I have grown a few points in all of my 4 sections,  but more importantly I am no longer under 18 in the two previous sections.  I am glad 
that I have had these tools introduced to me in order to assess my emotional intellgence and how it plays into my life. 

20 - Self Awareness - Improvement from below 18
22 - Self Management
22 - Social Awareness
20 - Relationship Management - Improvement from below 18

**Bias Assesment**

I do not remember my previous score for this assessment.  I believe that is because I scored in the top range and it did not cause me to become concerned.  I scored a 111 this time.
I will still do my best to consider my bias and the bias of others whenever I am making decision!
