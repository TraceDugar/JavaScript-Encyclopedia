## Data Strutures and Algorithms

1. We should consider what our use case is.  Each data structure has it's own set of benefits, as well as drawbacks.  Certain things that one data structure may be bad at, another one will be a better fit for achieving your desired results. I would first define the problem, and then review which data structure will most efficiently achieve the desired result.

2. We should define an end point for the loop. (Recursive Case)
