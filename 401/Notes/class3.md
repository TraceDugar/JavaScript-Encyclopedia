## class 3 notes


(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
1. Classes are a template for creating __objects__.
2. Can a class declaration be hoisted?
Yes
<br>

3. How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?
A constructor is a block of code that allows us to call certain traits of an object such as a ball.  The constructor may have things like size, color, weight, etc.
This allows us to create different balls without having to do lots of repetitive code.

1. Within Express, what does routing refer to?
Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests
<br>

2. What is the difference between a route path and a route method?
A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class, 
Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.
<br>

3.When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?
Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

1. What is an Express Router?
The express.Router() function is used to create a new router object.  Source:(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js-express-router-function/)
<br>

2. By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server? source :()
Unsure.

3. What do we use route middleware for?
Route middleware in Express is a way to do something before a request is processed. This could be things like checking if a user is authenticated, logging data for analytics, or anything else we’d like to do before we actually spit out information to our user.
<br>

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

I am hoping to understand the content , of route handling with one monolithic server.
