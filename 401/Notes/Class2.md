Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
funtions that interact with REQ / RES obj
Express the most popular Node Web Framework.
Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
Unopinionated frameworks, by contrast, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal,
or even what components should be used. They make it easier for developers to use the most suitable tools to complete a particular task, 
albeit at the cost that you need to find those components yourself

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function. Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express applications.
They allow us to make things to scale.

It allows us to know that we are writing the exact software to do a specific task in a specific way.
What are three expected benefits of testing
<ol>
