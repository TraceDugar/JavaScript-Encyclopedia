# Class 31 Reading Notes

(https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

What can React Context provide your app?
Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

Why might we use Context?
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

Why should we use it sparingly?
It makes component reuse more difficult.
