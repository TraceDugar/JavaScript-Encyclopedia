## Engineering Readings

1. Something unique I bring to the career field and employers would have to be a combined knowledge of basic design, art, and audio engineering (music).  The ways that this can benefit an employer is that I can Improve, Modify, or Repair (in some cases) assets that arecuicial to the constuction of a piece of software. (Graphics, Photos, Audio Recordings, etc.) as well as generate custom assets in some cases, that are of a High Quality.  Also I have lots of experience using various creative softwares from Adobe Creative suite to various video editors, and Digital Audio Workstations, as well as their plugins. Also I am quite knowledgable of the the gear from these various disciplines as well.<br>

2. 3 Things that I need to do in order to get unstuck.
<ol>
  <li>Read the problem twice, and vocalize it outloud while doing so.</li>
  <li>Utilize paper and pencils before I code,  work my way from problem to solution before coding.</li>
  <li>If all avenues of approach have been taken then I will ask for help with a clear understanding of what I am attempting to accomplish.</li>
</ol>
