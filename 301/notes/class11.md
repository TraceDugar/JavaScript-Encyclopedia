**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**<br>
**SQL**
<ol>
  <li>SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)</li>
  <li>SQL databases are table based databases</li>
  <li>SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data</li>
  <li>SQL databases have predefined schema</li>
  <li>SQL databases are vertically scalable</li>
  </ol>
  
**NoSQL**
 <ol>
  <li>NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database</li>
  <li>NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores</li>
  <li>NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to</li>
  <li>NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data</li>
  <li>NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable</li>
  </ol>

1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
*data that needs to be structured*
<br>
2. **Give a real world example.**
*E-commerce*
<br>
3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
*NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data).*
<br>
4. **Give a real world example.**
*Hbase*
<br>
5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
*SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.*
<br>
6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**
*For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.*

1.**What does SQL stand for?**
*Structured query Language*
<br>

2.**What is a relational database?**
*We have a database that works with certain assumptions*
<br>

3.**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**
*Table*
<br>

5.**What is a ‘schema’?**
*A way of organizing data*
<br>

6.**What is a NoSQL database?**
*The collection that contains documents*
<br>

7.**How does it work?**
*Data is stored in collections that contain documents, with key and value pairs. Less relational merging allows for faster queries.*
<br>

8.**What is inside of a MongoDB database?**
*Massive Amounts of Data, collections is what they are called, and then documents within*
<br>

9.**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
*MongoDB, it will allow you to get acess to mroe data, without a schema being implied*
<br>

10.**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
*There are no relations.*
