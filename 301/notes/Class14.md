1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?**
* Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.*

2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?**
* Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.*
* According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to*    
* organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."*

3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
* And in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. Research also links gender representation at the executive and board level with better company performance.*
