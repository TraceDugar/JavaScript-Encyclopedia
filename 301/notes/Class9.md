## Class 9 Reading Notes

**Functional Programming Concepts**

1. **What is functional programming?**
*Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data*
//^source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming
<br></br>

2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**
*It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic), and 
It does not cause any observable side effects.*
<br></br>

3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?**
*The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts*
<br></br>

4. **What is immutability?**
*When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.*
<br></br>

5. **What is Referential transparency?**
*Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.*

**Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()**

1. **WWhat is a module?**
*"Just another javascript file."*
<br></br>

2. **What does the word ‘require’ do?**
*"It brings in a module."*
<br></br>

3. **How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**
*"Recquire and the file name without its extension"*
<br></br>

4. **What do we have to do to make a module available?**
*"module.export"*
