## Notes for my reading assignments ##

**Hi my name is _Trace_, and I love Music.**

Growth Mindset is a mindset which will keep individuals on a path of continous improvement.
Failure is to be seen as an obstacle that can be overcome and should improve the individual once they get beyond it.
They are only a speedbump not the "End all, be all"

3 Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset.

- **Failure** is the best teacher
- Difficulties are temporary and there is _always_ a solution.
- You can do this, just stay _persistent_.
