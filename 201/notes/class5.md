## Class 5 Notes

**HTML**

1. Changing the name of an element from Dinosaur.jpg to "Dinosaur" which makes screen readers read it correctly.

2. Using Alt to rename an image to match what it is.

3. Figure can be used to add captions to images.

4. GIF, is a short animation loop, SVG is a drawing or icon that can grow or shrink depending upon the device it is being used in.

5. .PNG due to its lossless nature.

**CSS**

1. Back ground colors are colors that are behind the colors of the foreground.  Foreground colors will always be on top of background colors.

2. I would first apply some color to the background, the color the text with a secondaru color,  
I would use a couple of tertiary colors for other elements like borders and as well as certain lines of header text.

3. Make sure the font is available to be used on multiple browsers etc.

4. Font size, allows devs to grow/shrink a font to a desire size. 
Font Weight controls the boldness of a font.
Font Style toggles whether or not it is italicized.

5. You can add padding to the top, or a margin of an h1 in order to get it to appear as desired.
