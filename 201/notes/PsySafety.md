## Key Takeaways

**Teams that people feel safe, are a foundation for being the best team.**

  Teams that people could be themselves allowed them to take risks.  which means that people who would normally not speak up, were speaking up and providing effective solutions.
  The term they used for this is called "Psychological Safety".


**Teams that swapped leadership roles also did the best as a team.**

  I can 100% see how this works.  I do not like telling people what to do.  Even though I seem to have a knack for spotting peoples' strengths and playing off of those.
  I would musch rather not be in a position to have to do it all of the time. I do not mind sometimes, but most of the time I just would rather contribute to the team vs delegte.
