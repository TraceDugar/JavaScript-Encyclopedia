## Class 6 notes

**JS**

1. An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality.
//--https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics

2.Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually,
and it is easier to work with than an array,
when you want to identify individual items by name.

3. An Array is a collection of collected data, an object is data that is used to make things happen using JS.

4.This looks very similar to how you access the items in an array, and it is basically the same thing
instead of using an index number to select an item, you are using the name associated with each member's value.
It is no wonder that objects are sometimes called associative arrays
they map strings to values in the same way that arrays map numbers to values.

5.It is retunring information of the dogs and its age x7 as a sentence to be lopgged in the console.

**The DOM**

1.The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

2.That is to say, it is written in JavaScript, but uses the DOM to access the document and its elements.
The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.
The document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document.
They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.
