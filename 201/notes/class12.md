## Class 12 Reading Notes

**JS Canvas**

1. HTML5 features the <canvas> element that allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.
The <canvas> element requires at least two attributes: width and height that specify the size of the canvas.

2. The closing tag allows the element to end.

3. The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.

The 2D rendering context allows you to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.

**Chart JS Documentation**
  
1.  It makes a chart in JS, . All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single <canvas> node to render the chart.
  
2.  The chart types are Area, Bar, Bubble, Doughnut and Pie, Line, Mixed, Polar, Radar and Scatter Charts.

**Animated Charts, Chart .js**

  1. Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. 
  
  2. The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory youâ€™ll be working in.
