## Class 4 Notes

**HTML**

1. The a element is wrapped around text to create a hyperlink.

2. The href or Hypertext reference contains the web address.

3. *If a title's information is truly important to the usability of the page,
then you should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users,
for example by putting it in the regular text.*

**CSS**

1. Normal flow is the C in CSS, Cascading, from top to bottom.

2. *a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it,
and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content.*

*The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content.
You can't set width or height on inline elements â€” they just sit inside the content of block level elements.* 

3. Static positioning is the default for every html element.

4. *This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.
For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels,
UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on.*

5.*Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.
An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else*

**JS**

1. Declaring a function gives it a name, invoking the funcion is putting it to use.

2. *Parameters , these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly*
Arguments are just another name for parameters.

**Misc**

Greater Efficiency is the first advantage of Pair programming, another is engaged collaboration.
