## Class 3 Notes

### HTML

When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

**An unordered list should be used in a document whenever the order of the items are of no consequence.**

How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

**The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, 
using the list-style-type property.**

When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?

**The ordered list should be used whenever the order of the content is of some consequence, where as with 
unordered it is not.**

Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

**1 way is to use Roman numeral type, the other is to use the START attribute**


### CSS

Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story.
What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

**There once was a young element named Content, Content had 3 friends, Padding, Border, and Margin.  Element and Padding were the closest while border always remain neutral in arguments.  Then there was Margin.  Margin was jealous beause she was always on the ouside and felt like she could never get close to content because padding was always in the way.  She was cool with border though.  He was a bit of an outsider himself but he never got jealous of padding. Content was content with being the center of attention but was always with Padding there is no where that Content would go that Padding wouldn't.  Margin vehemetly hated Padding for this reason. Border would never allow Margin and Padding to fight, he was always there keeping the peace.  To this day if you look at the box model you will see that they have never changed.**

*Tldr, Margin is the spacing outside of the border,
Padding is the space in between the border and content.**

List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size 
and block-size or width and height.

- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace
between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

### JS

What data types can you store inside of an Array?

**Strings and Numbers**

Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

**Yes, it is an Array that keeps track of people, Items in an array are numbered, starting from zero. 
This number is called the item's index. So the first item has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. 
You can access individual items in the array using bracket notation and supplying the item's index, 
in the same way that you accessed the letters in a string.**

List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

-   x += f() addition
- 	x *= f() multiplication
- 	x <<= f() Left Shift
- 	x >>>= f() Copy right shift assignment
- 	x &&= f() Logical and Assignment

Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
